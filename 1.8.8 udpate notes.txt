seems that 1.8.8 uses quads for all world render objects that have normals ?
Converting a Tri to quad by supplying the same vertex for one of the points causes odd behavoir when rendering ...
	possilby issue with the way i'm rendering.

ibakedmodel is used to render blocks in the entites in 1.8 ... maybe use the OBJLOADER /OBJMODEL and convert to this?
needs research.
